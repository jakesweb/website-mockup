## Shipping Worldwide - Gridsome Testing

This is a testing site I am using to expirement with Gridsome/Vue.js.

Currently, I am running the site on Netlify at https://shipping-worldwide.netlify.app/

## To Test

To test the site, you just `npm install` and then run `npm run develop` which is a shortcut to run `gridsome develop`

## To Build

`gridsome build` runs the build script and the static site is hosted in the dist directory
